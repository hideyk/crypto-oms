## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the design of a cryptocurrency trading system that utilizes different cryptocurrency exchanges' SDKs to perform automated trading, risk management, and portfolio management. The system will aggregate market data, execute trades based on predefined strategies, and monitor portfolio performance across multiple exchanges.


### 1.2 Scope
The system will cater to:
- Spot and futures trading across Binance, OKX and Bybit
- Execution of algorithmic trading strategies
- Real-time monitoring of price, volume, and market depth
- Order execution and management
- Risk management, including stop-loss and position sizing
- Portfolio tracking across exchanges

### 1.3 Audience
The primary audience for this document includes software engineers and system architects interested in the development and deployment of the cryptocurrency Order Management System. 



## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture


### 2.2 Key Components
- Market Data Layer: Retrieves real-time market data (price, volume, order book) from the exchanges
- Strategy Engine: Executes trading strategies based on market conditions, indicators, and custom rules
- Order Management System: Handles sending buy/sell orders to exchanges and tracks order status
- Risk Management: Implements rules for stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing to minimize risk
- Portfolio Manager: Tracks current holdings, profits, and exposure across multiple exchanges
- Data Storage: SQL database for storing historical data, trading logs, and portfolio data
- User Interface: Dashboard to view trading performance, portfolio statistics and system status

## 3. Requirements


### 3.1 Functional Requirements
1. Multi-Exchange Support
   - Integrate APIs from Binanace, OKX and Bybit for spot and futures trading
2. Real-Time Market Data Aggregation
   - Fetch price, volume, and order book data in real-time
3. Order Management
   - Place market, limit, stop-loss, and take-profit orders on any supported exchange
   - Monitor order statuses (open, partially filled, closed)
4. Algorithmic Trading
   - Execute predefined strategies (e.g. mean reversion, trend-following, arbitrage)
   - Allow users to define custom trading algorithms
5. Risk Management
   - Implement stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing based on volatility, liquidity, or user-defined metrics
6. Portfolio Tracking
   - Track positions, profits and unrealized gains across all exchanges
7. Error handling & notifications
   - Handle API errors and provide retry mechanisms
   - Notify the user in case of failures, disconnections, or unexpected market conditions

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1. Scalability
   - System should scale to accommodate additional exchanges or high-frequency trading strategies
   - System should scale to accommodate surge in API calls and market volatility
2. Security
   - API keys and secrets should be stored securely and encrypted
   - Implement rate-limiting and API key maangement
3. Performance
   - Trading strategies should execute with minimal latency to ensure optimal order placement
4. Reliability
   - Ensure uptime for matket monitoring and order placement
5. Maintainability
- The system should be modular and maintanable, allowing easy updates and improvements
6. Auditability
- All trading activity should be logged for auditing purposes

## 4. API Integrations


### 4.1. Binance API Integration
- Data: Spot prices, order book depth, historical trades, candlestick data.
- Orders: Market, limit, stop-limit, take-profit.
- WebSocket: For real-time updates on price, order book, and order status.
- API Rate Limits: 1200 requests/min for account-related functions, 120 requests/min for market data.

### 4.2. OKX API Integration
- Data: Market data, perpetual futures, historical trades.
- Orders: Market, limit, stop-limit, conditional.
- WebSocket: For real-time price and trade execution updates.
- API Rate Limits: 6 requests/second.
### 4.3. Bybit API Integration
- Data: Spot, futures, options market data.
- Orders: Market, limit, stop-loss.
- WebSocket: Real-time order updates, position tracking.
- API Rate Limits: 50 requests/second (rate limiting varies per endpoint).

## 5. Date Flow

1. Market Data Flow
   - The system continuously requests real-time data from the Binance, OKX, and Bybit APIs.
   - This data is fed into the strategy engine, where it informs decision-making.
2. Trading Flow
   - Based on strategy outputs, the trade executor sends API requests to place orders
   - The system monitors the status of orders and updates the portfolio manager accordingly
3. Portfolio Management
   - After every trade, the portfolio manager updates asset balances and tracks unrealized P&L
   - Risk management modules assess exposure and adjust trading strategies if necessary


## 6. Database Design

1. Market Data:
   - Table: `market_data`
   - Fields: `timestamp`, `symbol`, `exchange`, `price`, `volume`, `order_book`
2. Order Logs:
   - Table: `order_logs`
   - Fields: `order_id`, `symbol`, `exchange`, `type`, `status`, `quantity`, `price`, `timestamp`
3. Portfolio:
   - Table: `portfolio`
   - Fields: `asset`, `quantity`, `average_price`, `exchange`, `timestamp`
4. Strategy Logs:
   - Table: `strategy_logs`
   - Fields: `strategy_id`, `timestamp`, `action_taken`, `reason`, `exchange`


## 7. Technology Stack

1. Backend:
   - Golang
2. Database:
   - Postgres
3. Frontend:
   - ReactJS
   - Websockets
4. Deployment:
   - GCP

## 8. Security Considerations
- All API Keys will be encrypted using AES-256 and stored in a secure vault (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Platform Secrets Manager)
- All communication between backend and exchanges will occur over HTTPS
- Implement rate-limiting to prevent API bans
- Use JWT-based authentication for access to the user interface
